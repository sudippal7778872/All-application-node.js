What do the different streams do?

1. The readable stream is a stream that is used for read operations.
2. The writable stream as the name suggests is a stream used for write operations.
3. A duplex stream is a stream that performs both read and write operations.
4. A transform stream is a stream that uses it input to compute an output.


The streams throw several events since they are eventEmitter instances. These events are used to track and monitor the stream.

Some of the most commonly used events are:

1. Data - Data event is emitted when readable data is available.
2. Finish - Finish event is emitted when the stream is done writing data.
3. Error - Error event is emitted when an error occurs while reading/writing data.
4. End - End event is emitted when the read stream has finished reading data.
